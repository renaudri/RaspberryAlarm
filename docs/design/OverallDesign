- The alarm should always run
	- eventually will create a startup script to start it
	
- Alarm should be armed/disarmed via single button
	- this can be a hidden button
	- can also be sequence programed that acts as key
	- arming should give time to leave
	
- Properties loaded by property file



- eventually alarm trigger can give off warning (gives you 10 seconds to react) to address false alarms
	- after warning it can go off for say 20 minutes...
